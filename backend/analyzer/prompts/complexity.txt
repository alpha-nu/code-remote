Analyze the following Python code and determine its time and space complexity.

## Code to analyze:
```python
{code}
```

## Instructions:
1. Identify the main algorithm or operations in the code
2. Analyze the time complexity using Big O notation
3. Analyze the space complexity using Big O notation
4. Provide a brief explanation for each

## Response format (respond ONLY with this JSON structure, no markdown):
{{
  "time_complexity": "O(...)",
  "space_complexity": "O(...)",
  "time_explanation": "Brief explanation of why this time complexity",
  "space_explanation": "Brief explanation of why this space complexity",
  "algorithm_identified": "Name or description of the main algorithm if recognizable",
  "suggestions": ["Optional improvement suggestions"]
}}

Be precise and technical. If the code has multiple functions, analyze the overall complexity considering typical usage patterns.
