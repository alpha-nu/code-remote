Analyze the following Python code and determine its time and space complexity.

## Code to analyze:
```python
{code}
```

## Instructions:
1. Identify the main algorithm or operations
2. Determine time complexity (Big O notation)
3. Determine space complexity (Big O notation)
4. Keep explanations VERY brief (1-2 sentences max each)

## CRITICAL: Response constraints
- MAXIMUM 500 tokens total
- Each explanation: 1-2 sentences ONLY
- No verbose descriptions - be concise and technical
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no markdown code blocks
- Empty suggestions array unless truly critical

## Response format:
{{
  "time_complexity": "O(...)",
  "space_complexity": "O(...)",
  "time_explanation": "One brief sentence.",
  "space_explanation": "One brief sentence.",
  "algorithm_identified": "Algorithm name or null",
  "suggestions": []
}}

Example of ideal brevity:
{{
  "time_complexity": "O(n²)",
  "space_complexity": "O(1)",
  "time_explanation": "Nested loops over input array.",
  "space_explanation": "Only constant extra variables used.",
  "algorithm_identified": "Bubble sort",
  "suggestions": []
}}
