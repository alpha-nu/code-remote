Analyze the following Python code and determine its time and space complexity.

## Code to analyze:
```python
{code}
```

## Instructions:
Write a concise Markdown analysis with the following sections. Use EXACTLY these headings.

### Algorithm
Identify the main algorithm or technique. 1 sentence.

### Time Complexity: O(...)
Include the Big O in the heading. Explain WHY in 1-2 sentences.

### Space Complexity: O(...)
Include the Big O in the heading. Explain WHY in 1-2 sentences.

### Suggestions
Bullet list of 1-3 practical improvements. Omit this section entirely if none apply.

## CRITICAL: Response constraints
- MAXIMUM 500 tokens for the Markdown section
- Be concise and technical — no filler
- After the Markdown, output a single fenced JSON block with ONLY the Big O values:

```json
{{"time_complexity": "O(...)", "space_complexity": "O(...)"}}
```

## Example response:

### Algorithm
Bubble sort — a comparison-based sorting algorithm.

### Time Complexity: O(n²)
Nested loops iterate over the input array, comparing adjacent elements.

### Space Complexity: O(1)
Sorts in-place with only constant extra variables.

### Suggestions
- Use Python's built-in `sorted()` for O(n log n) average performance.
- Consider insertion sort for nearly-sorted inputs.

```json
{{"time_complexity": "O(n²)", "space_complexity": "O(1)"}}
```
