# Archived Documentation

This folder contains legacy documentation that has been superseded by the new structure.

## Why Archived?

These documents were created during earlier development phases and may contain:
- Outdated information
- Planned features that were implemented differently
- Phase-specific details now consolidated elsewhere

## Current Documentation

See the main [docs/README.md](../README.md) for current documentation:

- [Architecture](../architecture/) - System design
- [Deployment](../deployment/) - CI/CD and releases
